# Exploring the effects of thermal plasticity on adaptation to climate change

This application allows you to explore how can phenotypic plasticity in 
thermal performance curves (TPC) aids adaptation to changing thermal environments.
Adjust the thermal optima ($T_{opt}$) and critical thermal limits ($CT_{min}$ and $CT_{min}$ ) to
shape the TPC. Set an initial temperature distribution (initial mean and standard deviation) 
and explore how changes in mean and thermal variability (change in SD) impact performance.
You can also control the TPC's acclimation response ratio ($ARR$) which will determine
how much do all thermal physiology traits change as a function of changes in mean temperature 
(e.g., $ARR$ = 0.5 will mean that all thermal physiology traits will change by 50% the amount by
which the mean environmental temperature changes)
